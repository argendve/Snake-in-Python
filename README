A Simple Snake game made in python.
Uses pygame for the graphics.
Starts automatically and ends automatically as well.
Uses 3 files --
One for the blocks of the snake, for the food, and the main file

Simply draws rects and updates according to key presses.
Other blocks follow the block ahead of it unless it is the head where it moves independent of other blocks.
